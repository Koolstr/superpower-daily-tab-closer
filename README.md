# superpower-daily-tab-closer
A very simple script that auto-closes the incredibly annoying tab opened daily from the Superpower ChatGPT browser extension, saving your sanity and time. You'll never be bothered by it again.

This method is so effective & invisible that you don't even notice it taking place. I've been using it reliably for months; all this time, I completely about this daily tab that used to be opened. It only came back to mind now, that I now decided to share this method.

Note, this breaks access to the superpowerdaily.com home page root address entirely. You won't be able to navigate to that address even manually while this script is enabled. A tiny price to pay for this convenience.

## Installation
Add the script to Tampermonkey, or your preferred userscript manager. The script can be found on GreasyFork [here](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/485660-auto-close-superpower-daily-tab) for ease of installation. Enjoy!
